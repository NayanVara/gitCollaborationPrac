overall, very lovely website!! i like the navigation bar and use of pages to convey seperate ideas with an overaching theme. If i were to critique I'd say you should improve your landing page so that one understands what the content on people's pages will be rather than it being a surprise on what the topic is after opening the page via the navigation bar.

    Interest of content
Good, interesting take to do AI in medicine with informative seperate pages.

    Consistency and quality of visual presentation
consistent colour scheme, very nice! and nice use of images

    Quality of written presentation
very informative!

    Validity of HTML
Use of navigation bar, images, and heading and bold text in Simon'spage 

    Evidence of collaboration including

        Author info not written by author
I can see this on pages such as Lysander's and simon's

        Balanced contributions from members
Everyone has their own page! though some pages are a bit more detailed than others
