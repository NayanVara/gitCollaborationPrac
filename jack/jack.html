<p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. It involves using technologies, processes, and controls to defend against threats like malware, phishing, and data theft, and to safeguard digital services and personal information. The goal is to minimize the risk of unauthorized access, damage, or disruption to our increasingly connected digital world. 
Core principles and practices
Authentication: Verifying who is trying to access a system, often through methods like passwords, security keys, or biometrics.
Authorization: Determining what an authenticated user is allowed to access.
Confidentiality: Ensuring sensitive information is only accessible to those who have authorization, using tools like encryption.
Integrity: Making sure data is accurate and hasn't been tampered with.
Availability: Ensuring that systems and data are accessible when needed.
Risk Management: Integrating cybersecurity into a broader risk management strategy, which includes preparing for incidents like data breaches and service disruptions. 
Common threats and risks
Malware: Malicious software, including ransomware.
Phishing: Scams designed to trick users into revealing sensitive information.
Data Theft: Unauthorized acquisition of data.
AI-Powered Attacks: Threats that leverage artificial intelligence to become more sophisticated.
Service Disruptions: Attacks that can take down critical services or infrastructure. 
Why it's important
Protects businesses: Helps organizations avoid financial losses, service disruptions, and reputational damage from cyberattacks.
Safeguards individuals: Protects personal information stored on devices and in the cloud.
Secures critical infrastructure: Ensures that essential services, like those provided by governments, can continue to operate.
Enables innovation: Allows new technologies to be deployed securely, so their benefits can be realized. </p>
